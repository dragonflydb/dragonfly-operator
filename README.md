Dragonfly Operator is a Kubernetes operator used to deploy and manage [Dragonfly](https://dragonflydb.io/) instances inside your Kubernetes clusters.
Main features include:

- Automatic failover
- Scaling up/down the number of instances

You can find more information about Dragonfly in the [official documentation](https://dragonflydb.io/docs/).

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

- Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/dragonfly-operator:tag
```

- Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

> **Note**
>
> If you are using `kind`, You can load the image instead of pushing to a registry by running
>
> ```sh
> make docker-kind-load IMG=<some-registry>/dragonfly-operator:tag
> ```

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/dragonfly-operator:tag
```

- Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```
